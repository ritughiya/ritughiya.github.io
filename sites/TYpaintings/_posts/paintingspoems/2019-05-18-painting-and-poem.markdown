# EPISODE IN THE LIFE OF SAINT HORTUS (CONVERSATION ON THE PSYCHEDELIC LAWN)
## by Allyson Paty

The gods turn up the sun, make it huge, hot-pink<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the black-hatched sky. Hortus, scrawny sprite,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appears thrice on ascent through the ornamental trees: <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sitting now on a bough, now swinging, now perched
				<!--more-->
up top for a word: “O, Sun, I climb toward you from<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the golden below to wash in the leaves your light most<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;haunts and go a little spectral in devotion. I no longer<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know, does the garden rise in health or radiation? See<br>
the hornbeam trees’ Singaporean heights, how<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lately their shadows turn color, get up, and roam.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, my friend—see there? down on the ground?—<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sprouted fawn legs and can’t but sweetly recline...”<br>
The sun’s twin heads come out to lay their flesh<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever so gently over the sky. One draws a solid wind,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slides Hortus (not by choice) to the grass in safety,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one gives a light so bright it makes all the world<br>
see-through. In chorus: “Glow contingent, Hortus.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leak. Peer into anything—stone, your friend, the air—	<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each overlays another. Like so, I drape my hand.”
