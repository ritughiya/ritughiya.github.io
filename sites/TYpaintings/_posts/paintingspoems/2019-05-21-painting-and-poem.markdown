# For the elders

## by Jessica Lynne

I remember how the elders would praise their god: <br>
<i>Ye, though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death</i> <br>
we will fear no evil <br>
<i>for you are with us</i>
&nbsp; <br> <br>

I too have learned how to give thanks to the spirits who guide me: <br>
for the hazy sunsets of orange and yellow and pink that swallow my fear <br>
a quiet that reminds me I am never alone <br>
for the large droplets of rain that cool my angst <br>
always arriving in three, a holy descent <br>
for fertile brown earth that steadies my way <br>
along a path unknown <br>
 <br>

for the elders, who first taught me how to pray <br>
